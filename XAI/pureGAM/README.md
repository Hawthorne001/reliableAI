# pureGAM Model overview
1. pureGAM, an inherently pure additive model of both main effects and higher-order interactions, is implemented
in __pureGAM_model/pureGAM.py__ ;
2. Imitate __experiments/run_experiment_realdata.py__ or __experiments/run_experiment_realdata.py__ 
(which is examples of applying pureGAM in real datasets and synthetic datasets, respectively) to specify 
the datasets and hyper-parameters of pureGAM.
3. To use your own data
   1. For real data, you may place the datasets in __realdata/__ folder
   2. For synthetic data, you can write your own scripts in __synthetic_datagenerator/__
4. pureGAM and other XAI model can use metrics in __metrics/__ to evaluate the pureness of their results.

# Run `pureGAM` experiments

1. Use requirements.txt to initialize the environment and install packages.
2. Core code is in __experiments__
   1. Run __experiments/run_experiment_realdata.py__ for real data experiment
   2. Run __synthetic_datagenerator/categorical_gen.py__ and __synthetic_datagenerator/numerical_gen.py__ 
   to generate synthetic data.
   3. Run __experiments/run_synthetic_cate.py__ and __experiments/run_synthetic_num.py__ for synthetic data experiment


<!--
## MMPC, REAL and others

We are still working on making our implementation on MMPC and REAL publicly
available. Please stay tuned. 

You may also modify the `estimate_bn` method to support other algorithms as long
as it returns a valid instance of `pgmpy.models.BayesianNetwork`.

<!--
## known issues
1. Due to the limitation of this implementation, for categorical data with arbitrary interactions that is 
   not grid-close, `pureGAM` can throw an exception and crush.
